# ROB-310-Project---Bayesian-Tracking-WIth-Prime-Number

This is the project I developed for ROB 310 - Mathematics for Robotics, a course in the 3rd year of the Robotics Engineering major in UofT's Engineering Science program. 
This repository includes the student version of the assignment, the solution to the assignment, and a report summarizing the results and possible improvements.
